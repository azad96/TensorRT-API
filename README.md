# TensorRT-API
This repository consists of models which I implemented in TensorRT Network Definition API

TensorRT-API is useful when there is something wrong with the ONNX model to be used in inference. In this case, whole network is written layer by layer in TensorRT.
I began implementing my models by taking [tensorrtx](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx) as my starting point.
